

Hey! I'm **Gauransh Kajla**, a 19-year-old passionate learner from India.  
I first logged into GitHub as a curious kid back in 2021 when I was 15.  
I was experimenting with small games and learning bit by bit, but I had no clue where to put my work.  
Then high school exams hit, and like many others, I had to pause everything.


In 2025, Iâ€™ve officially restarted my coding journey with **Python** as my first real step forward.  

This time, Iâ€™m learning, building, uploading â€” and preparing for a **real future in tech**:  
Freelancing, internships, and eventually a strong job.
